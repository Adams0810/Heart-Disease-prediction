# Heart-Disease-prediction
This project predicts heart disease using machine learning models based on patient health data. It covers end-to-end steps: data preprocessing, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand distributions and correlations. Models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM are trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Random Forest achieved the best performance. The project demonstrates how ML can assist in early diagnosis of heart disease and serve as a foundation for healthcare decision-support systems
